## Apriori for YelpRun: python2.7 apriori.py    Examines the frequent patterns (stores visited by yelp customers)Results: ```min\_support: 50 min_conf: 0.25item: "Wicked Spoon","Holsteins Shakes & Buns" , 51.000item: "Wicked Spoon","Secret Pizza" , 52.000item: "Wicked Spoon","Earl of Sandwich" , 52.000item: "The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas","Wicked Spoon" , 54.000item: "Mon Ami Gabi","Wicked Spoon" , 57.000item: "Bacchanal Buffet","Wicked Spoon" , 63.000```Explanations: I have googled the stores, and interestingly, all of them are in Cosmopolitan Las Vegas. The result makes sense because the stores are together, and people who go to Vegas tend to stay there for a while, and to have multiple meals. Hence, these stores tend to be visited together for a user.
